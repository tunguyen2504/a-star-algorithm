# a-star-algorithm
A* algorithm to find the shortest path between two cities.
The project consists in implementing a C version of the A* algorithm seen in class, in order to find
the shortest path between two cities of a given road map.
The information regarding the cities is given in a text file named FRANCE.MAP. This file contains
lines with 3 elements (city name + coordinates) and lines with 2 elements (neigbour name +
distance).
